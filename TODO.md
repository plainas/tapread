# prioritized todo

- [ ] start menu (button before playing the game)
- [ ] popup modal to hold menus and other stuff like that
- [ ] picking the wordpacks and saving the default one in html local cache

## notes

This modal is the best. Simpler and straightforward. much better than using shitty libraries

create helper functions that just take the id of the top element for the modal and then follow conventions regarding css classes for close buttons and the like
